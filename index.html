  <p>Welcome to my portfolio! You will probably notice the page is quite simple at the moment. This is beacause I am just now learning how to code! <strong>I have been at it for one week so far!</strong> This is just the beginning! I will be learning how to code for the next six months which is really exciting! Before you know it this page will be improved!</p>
